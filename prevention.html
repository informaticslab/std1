<p class="p1">Prevention</p>
<p class="p2">Primary prevention of STD begins with changing the sexual behaviors that place persons at risk for infection. Health-care providers have a unique opportunity to provide education and counseling to their patients. As part of the clinical interview, health-care providers should routinely and regularly obtain sexual histories from their patients and address management of risk reduction as indicated in this report. Guidance in obtaining a sexual history is available in <i>Contraceptive Technology, 18th edition</i> <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2006/ref.htm#ref5"><span class="s1">(5)</span></a> and in the curriculum provided by CDC’s <a href="http://www.stdhivpreventiontraining.org/"><span class="s1">STD/HIV Prevention Training Centers</span></a>. Counseling skills, characterized by respect, compassion, and a nonjudgmental attitude toward all patients, are essential to obtaining a thorough sexual history and to delivering prevention messages effectively. Key techniques that can be effective in facilitating rapport with patients include the use of 1) open-ended questions (e.g., “Tell me about any new sex partners you’ve had since your last visit” and “what’s your experience with using condoms been like?”), 2) understandable language (“have you ever had a sore or scab on your penis?”), and 3) normalizing language (“some of my patients have difficulty using a condom with every sex act. How is it for you?”). One approach to eliciting information concerning five key areas of interest has been summarized.</p>
<p class="p2">The Five Ps: Partners, Prevention of Pregnancy, Protection from STDs, Practices, Past History of STDs</p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li3">Partners</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3">“Do you have sex with men, women, or both?”</li>
    <li class="li3">“In the past 2 months, how many partners have you had sex with?”</li>
    <li class="li3">“In the past 12 months, how many partners have you had sex with?”</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3">Prevention of pregnancy</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3">"Are you or your partner trying to get pregnant?” If no, “What are you doing to prevent pregnancy?”</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3">Protection from STDs</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3">“What do you do to protect yourself from STDs and HIV?”</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3">Practices</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3">“To understand your risks for STDs, I need to understand the kind of sex you have had recently.”</li>
    <li class="li3">“Have you had vaginal sex, meaning ‘penis in vagina sex’”?</li>
    <li class="li3">If yes, “Do you use condoms: never, sometimes, or always?”</li>
    <li class="li3">“Have you had anal sex, meaning ‘penis in rectum/anus sex’”?</li>
    <li class="li3">If yes, “Do you use condoms: never, sometimes, or always?”</li>
    <li class="li3">“Have you had oral sex, meaning ‘mouth on penis/ vagina’”?</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3">For condom answers:</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3">If “never:” “Why don’t you use condoms?”</li>
    <li class="li3">If “sometimes”: “In what situations or with whom, do you not use condoms?”</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3">Past history of STDs</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3">“Have you ever had an STD?”</li>
    <li class="li3">“Have any of your partners had an STD?”</li>
  </ul>
  <li class="li3">Additional questions to identify HIV and hepatitis risk</li>
  <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="li3">“Have you or any of your partners ever injected drugs?</li>
    <li class="li3">“Have any of your partners exchanged money or drugs for sex?”</li>
    <li class="li3">“Is there anything else about your sexual practices that I need to know about?”</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<p class="p2">Patients should be reassured that treatment will be provided regardless of individual circumstances (e.g., ability to pay, citizenship or immigration status, language spoken, or specific sex practices). Many patients seeking treatment or screening for a particular STD should be evaluated for all common STDs; even so, all patients should be informed concerning all the STDs for which they are being tested and if testing for a common STD (e.g., genital herpes) is not being performed.</p>
