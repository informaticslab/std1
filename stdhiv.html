<p class="p3">Effective delivery of prevention messages requires that providers integrate communication of general risk reduction messages that are relevant to the client (i.e., client-centered counseling) and education regarding specific actions that can reduce the risk for STD/HIV transmission (e.g., abstinence, condom use, limiting the number of sex partners, modifying sexual behaviors, and vaccination). Each of these specific actions is discussed separately in this report.</p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li4">Interactive counseling approaches directed at a patient’s personal risk, the situations in which risk occurs, and the use of goal-setting strategies are effective in STD/HIV prevention <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2006/ref.htm#ref6"><span class="s1">(6)</span></a>. One such approach, client-centered STD/ HIV prevention counseling, involves tailoring a discussion of risk reduction to the patient’s individual situation. Client-centered counseling can have a beneficial effect on the likelihood of patients using risk-reduction practices and can reduce the risk for future acquisition of an STD. One effective client-centered approach is Project RESPECT, which demonstrated that a brief counseling intervention was associated with a reduced frequency of STD/HIV risk-related behaviors and with a lowered acquisition of STDs <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2006/ref.htm#ref7"><span class="s1">(7,8)</span></a>. Practice models based on Project RESPECT have been successfully implemented in clinic-based settings. Other approaches use motivational interviewing to move clients toward achievable risk reduction goals. CDC provides <a href="http://effectiveinterventions.org/"><span class="s1">additional information on these and other effective behavioral interventions</span></a>.</li>
  <li class="li4">Interactive counseling can be used effectively by all health-care providers or can be conducted by specially trained counselors. The quality of counseling is best ensured when providers receive basic training in prevention counseling methods and skill-building approaches, periodic observation of counseling with immediate feedback by persons with expertise in the counseling approach, periodic counselor and/or patient satisfaction evaluations, and availability of expert assistance or referral for challenging situations. Training in client-centered counseling is available through the CDC <a href="http://www.stdhivpreventiontraining.org/"><span class="s1">STD/HIV Prevention Training Centers</span></a>. Prevention counseling is most effective if provided in a nonjudgmental manner appropriate to the patient’s culture, language, sex, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p3">In addition to individual prevention counseling, some videos and large group presentations provide explicit information concerning how to use condoms correctly. These have been effective in reducing the occurrence of additional STDs among persons at high risk, including STD clinic patients and adolescents.</p>
<p class="p3">Because the incidence of some STDs, notably syphilis, has increased in HIV-infected persons, the use of client-centered STD counseling for HIV-infected persons has received strong emphasis from public health agencies and organizations. Consensus guidelines issued by CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the National Institutes of Health emphasize that STD/HIV risk assessment, STD screening, and client-centered risk reduction counseling should be provided routinely to HIV-infected persons <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2006/ref.htm#ref9"><span class="s1">(9)</span></a>. Several specific methods have been designed for the HIV care setting <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2006/ref.htm#ref10"><span class="s1">(10–12)</span></a>. <a href="http://effectiveinterventions.org/"><span class="s1">Additional information regarding these approaches is available</span></a>.</p>
